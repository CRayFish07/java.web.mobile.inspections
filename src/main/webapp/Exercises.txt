Exercise:  
1)  Write a JSP/HTML set that allows a user to enter the name of a 
system property, and then displays the value returned by System.getProperty for
 that property name (handle errors appripriately.)   
 2)  Go back to the exercises where you manually modified boolean variables.  
 Instead of a boolean variable, make these come from a HIDDEN form field that 
 can be set to true or false.
